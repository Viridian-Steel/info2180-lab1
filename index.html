            <h2>Daniel Smith</h2>
            <p>I am a student at UWI pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I am 20 years old, and wish ot ultimately be a game developer.
                However, a combination of being in university full-time, poor time management, and poor impulse control, not much progress has been made in my game development jouney.
                I am interested in web development because I wish to be able to wrtie my own webpages from scratch.
